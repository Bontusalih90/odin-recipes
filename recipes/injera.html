    <p>Injera is the staple bread of Ethiopia. It's traditionally made with teff flour, but regular millet flour from a health food store will work fine and give a similar nutty flavor. Use this bread to sop up the flavors of spicy stews.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>5 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>&#188 teasoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and honey in 1/4 cup water. Let stand until yeast softens <br> and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 4 3/4 <br>cups water and millet flour; stir until smooth. Cover and let stand at room <br> temperature for 24 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir batter well and mix in baking soda.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/3 cup batter into <br> the pan in a spiral pattern; quickly tilt the pan and swirl to even out batter so it <br> covers the bottom of the pan. Cover and cook until injera rises slightly and is <br> slightly moist on top but not browned, about 1 minute. Without flipping (injera <br> is only cooked on one side), remove to a platter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Repeat to cook remaining injera, stacking on the plate when finished.</li>
    </ol>
